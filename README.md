# 📈 TATA Elxsi Stock Forecasting with Prophet & LSTM

This project forecasts the stock price of TATA Elxsi using two powerful techniques:
- Facebook Prophet (with log & non-log models)
- LSTM Neural Networks (Keras + TensorFlow)

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Outlier handling & preprocessing
- 📅 Holiday calendar support for India (Prophet)
- 🔁 Log transformation option for better Prophet performance
- 🔮 LSTM model with MinMax scaling and future forecasting
- 📊 Evaluation using MAPE and Prophet cross-validation
- 📁 CSV export of all forecasts (Prophet and LSTM)

Just wrapped up a full forecasting pipeline using Facebook Prophet & LSTM on TATA Elxsi stock price data!

📊 What’s inside?
✅ Data preprocessing & outlier handling  
✅ Dual Prophet models (log & non-log) with Indian holiday effects  
✅ LSTM model with MAPE evaluation  
✅ 30-day forecast exported to CSV  
✅ Full automation, fast execution, and clean code

🔁 Techniques used:
- Time series forecasting
- Log transformation
- Feature engineering
- LSTM neural networks
- Model evaluation with MAPE and Prophet cross-validation

📈 Check out the results:
🧠 Prophet MAPE: ~{mape_raw:.2f}% (raw), ~{mape_log:.2f}% (log-transformed)  
🧠 LSTM MAPE: ~{mape_lstm:.2f}%
